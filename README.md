# Hotel Guest Satisfaction Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explores patterns and relationships in guest satisfaction using a dataset of 504 TripAdvisor reviews across 21 hotels on the Las Vegas Strip. Our research focuses on the influence of hotel amenities and star ratings on guest experiences, and examines the impact of online engagement metrics on reviewer ratings.

## Key Techniques Used
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Regression Modeling
- T-tests
- Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
- Classification Models

## Major Findings
- Significant positive correlation between specific amenities (e.g., pools and gyms) and higher guest satisfaction scores.
- Online engagement metrics do not significantly influence satisfaction scores, suggesting reviewer activity levels do not bias their ratings.
